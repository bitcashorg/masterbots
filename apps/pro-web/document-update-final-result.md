# Expand operational alignment checklist section focusing transition

This is a new text document for Biz.

## Overview

Purpose
This document provides a practical, operational alignment checklist designed to ensure safe, timely, and minimally disruptive transitions for workplace changes (relocations, capacity scaling, site closures, major reconfigurations, or service model changes). It translates strategic transition objectives into clear, accountable operational tasks so teams can coordinate facilities, people, vendors, and systems with measurable assurance of readiness and recovery.

### Scope

- Applies to organizational transitions that impact physical workplaces, core facilities services, or cross-functional operational dependencies.
- Covers pre-transition planning, cutover execution, and post-transition validation and remediation.
- Includes activities across facilities, workplace services, vendor management, security/compliance, HR touchpoints, IT handoffs (coordination only; detailed IT runbooks remain separate), and stakeholder communications.
- Excludes routine facilities maintenance and ad-hoc one-off requests that do not require formal cutover or multi-team coordination.

#### Secondary audience and responsibilities

- HR Leads
  - Manage people-related activities: communication plans, occupancy rules, access provisioning, accommodations, and employee safety briefings.
  - Confirm headcount alignment, move schedules for staff, and completion of any required employee training or certifications.
  - Validate employee-impact items on the checklist and provide sign-off for people readiness gates.
- IT Transition Liaisons
  - Coordinate IT handoffs and ensure IT preconditions are met (power, racks, network ports, circuits); confirm connectivity tests and service availability.
  - Provide evidence of ticketed IT activities and escalate unresolved technical blockers to Change Management.
  - Validate that application- and infrastructure-level cutover dependencies are documented and sequenced.
- Security & Compliance Owners
  - Review and approve physical and logical security controls, access changes, and regulatory requirements impacting the transition.
  - Confirm permits, incident response readiness, and continuity of compliance reporting where applicable.
  - Sign off on safety checkpoints and any control changes before go/no-go.
- Procurement / Vendor Managers
  - Ensure vendor SLAs, delivery windows, and on-site resourcing align with scheduled activities.
  - Verify vendor insurance, permits, and access authorizations; collect vendor acceptance evidence for completed scope items.
  - Coordinate contingency suppliers if primary vendors fail to meet commitments.
- Business-Unit Sponsors
  - Represent business operational readiness and accept functional impacts or mitigations.
  - Approve business-facing communications and confirm readiness of systems/processes that support customers or revenue streams.
  - Provide final business acceptance for service restoration and handback.

#### Executive sponsors and governance

- Executive Sponsors
  - Receive summarized assurance reports and the Transition Owner’s go/no‑go recommendation.
  - Make the formal acceptance decision for high-risk or high-impact transitions.
  - Provide escalation support for funding, policy exceptions, or cross-organization prioritization.
- Governance & Approval Bodies (Change Board, Risk/Compliance Committee)
  - Review exception requests, scope reclassifications, and material risks escalated from the cutover.
  - Approve re-scoping, emergency reclassification, and final closeout where policy requires higher-level ratification.

#### Cross-functional contributors and supporting roles

- Facilities Operations Staff: execute trades, manage mechanical/electrical tasks, and verify environmental controls.
- Workplace Experience / Service Desk: handle employee queries, on-day logistics, and immediate post-cutover requests; log and prioritize incidents.
- Legal / Contracts: validate any contractual or regulatory implications of vendor swaps, site closures, or asset transfers.
- Finance: confirm cost approvals, budget holds, and reconciliation for transition-related spend.
- Risk / Business Continuity: monitor operational risk posture, validate continuity plans, and confirm readiness of recovery actions.

#### Responsibilities matrix and acceptance criteria

- Each named role must have:
  - Assigned checklist items with clear acceptance criteria and required evidence types (e.g., signed form, ticket closure, photo).
  - A designated backup to act during unavailability.
  - A timeframe for sign-off (absolute deadline relative to cutover start).
- Acceptance criteria examples:
  - Physical handover: vendor-signed delivery note + photograph of installed asset + inventory updated.
  - Connectivity readiness: network test report with pass/fail results and CI ticket closed.
  - People readiness: HR confirmation of moved headcount and completed safety briefing roster.
- Non-compliance path:
  - If acceptance criteria are unmet, the responsible role must document reason, mitigation plan, and estimated resolution time; Transition Owner evaluates impact and may delay cutover per governance rules.

### Key objectives and success criteria

- Objectives:
  - Ensure continuity of critical services and safety of occupants during the transition.
  - Minimize unplanned downtime and user disruption.
  - Maintain compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations.
  - Preserve asset and data integrity through controlled transfer and documentation.
- Success criteria (examples to be verified during transition):
  - All pre-cutover items completed and signed off by named owners.
  - Zero critical safety incidents during the cutover window.
  - Critical systems/services restored within agreed SLA targets.
  - Post-transition employee satisfaction at or above agreed baseline for workplace experience.

### How to use this checklist

- Readiness assessment: Use the checklist to perform a gap analysis during planning sprints; mark items as Not Started / In Progress / Complete with owner and due date.
- Cutover control: During execution, operate from the checklist as the single source of truth; enforce real-time verification artifacts (photos, tickets, signatures).
- Handover and close: Require a documented handover with final sign-offs, a short observation period, and a scheduled retrospective to capture lessons and update SOPs.
- Integration: Align checklist items with project plan milestones, the incident escalation matrix, and vendor contracts to ensure traceability and accountability.### Scope
