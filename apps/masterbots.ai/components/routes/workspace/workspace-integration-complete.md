# Yoopta Rich Text Editor Integration - Complete

## Summary

The Yoopta rich text editor has been successfully integrated into the workspace content component with a minimalist UI. This integration is now available in the chat-panel-pro feature.

## What's Been Done

1. **Created the Yoopta Editor Component**:
   - Implemented in `yoopta-editor.tsx`
   - Uses Yoopta packages for rich text editing
   - Provides bidirectional Markdown conversion

2. **Updated the Workspace Content**:
   - Modified `workspace-content.tsx` to include the Yoopta editor
   - Added a toggle button in the tab UI for better discoverability
   - Implemented conditional rendering based on editor mode

3. **Added a Minimalist Toggle**:
   - Placed the toggle button in the tab bar alongside Section/Source tabs
   - Used small, recognizable icons (pencil for rich editor, code for plain)
   - Made the button context-aware - appears only when in Source view
   - Color scheme matches the application's design language

## How to Use

1. Open a text document in the workspace
2. Click on the "Full Source" tab to view the document source
3. Use the "Rich/Plain" toggle button at the top right of the tab bar to switch between editors:
   - Click "Rich" to use the Yoopta rich text editor
   - Click "Plain" to use the standard plain text editor
4. Edit your content with formatting tools when in rich mode
5. Changes from both editors are kept in sync and will be reflected in the Section Editor view

## Implementation Details

- The Yoopta editor includes essential plugins for headings, lists, code blocks, etc.
- Text formatting marks for bold, italic, underline, etc. are available
- Editor tools include toolbar, action menu, and link tool
- Markdown syntax is preserved when switching between editors

## Files Updated

1. `yoopta-editor.tsx`: Contains the Yoopta editor implementation
2. `workspace-content.tsx`: Updated with the toggle and integration

All files are now synchronized and the feature is ready for use in the main application.
