# Yoopta Rich Text Editor Integration

## Overview

The Yoopta rich text editor has been successfully integrated into the workspace text editor. This integration provides a toggle feature that allows users to switch between a plain text editor (using Textarea) and a rich text editor (using Yoopta).

## Implementation Details

1. Created a `YooptaEditor` component that:
   - Converts Markdown to Yoopta's internal format
   - Provides a rich editing experience with formatting tools
   - Converts the Yoopta format back to Markdown on changes

2. Integrated the editor into the workspace content with:
   - A toggle button to switch between editors
   - Proper state management to keep both editors in sync
   - Seamless conversion between formats

## Features

The Yoopta editor implementation includes:

- **Rich Text Editing**: Format text with bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc.
- **Block Elements**: Headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and dividers
- **Interactive Tools**: Toolbar, action menu, and link tool
- **Markdown Conversion**: Bi-directional conversion between Markdown and Yoopta formats

## Usage

When editing a text document in the workspace:

1. Click on the "Full Source" tab to view the document source
2. Use the "Switch to Rich Editor" button to toggle between plain text and rich editor
3. The rich editor provides formatting tools and a more visual editing experience
4. Changes are automatically converted to Markdown when you switch back to plain text mode

## Technical Components

The implementation consists of:

- **yoopta-editor.tsx**: Contains the Yoopta editor integration with Markdown conversion
- **workspace-content.tsx**: Updated with the toggle feature and editor integration

## Dependencies

The integration uses the following Yoopta packages:

- `@yoopta/editor`: Core editor functionality
- `@yoopta/paragraph`, `@yoopta/headings`, etc.: Block plugins
- `@yoopta/marks`: Text formatting marks (bold, italic, etc.)
- `@yoopta/toolbar`, `@yoopta/action-menu-list`, etc.: Editor tools

## Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements:

1. Better Markdown to Yoopta conversion (more complex elements)
2. Custom styling to match the application's design
3. Additional plugins for specialized content types
4. Improved performance for large documents
