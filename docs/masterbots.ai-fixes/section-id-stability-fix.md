# Section ID Stability Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The original issue was that section IDs were generated using an incrementing counter (`section-1`, `section-2`, etc.), which caused mismatches between:

1. **Active Section State**: The `activeWorkspaceSection` stored in the workspace chat hook
2. **Parsed Section IDs**: The IDs generated when re-parsing the markdown content

### Original Implementation Issues

```typescript
// OLD: Unstable ID generation
currentSection = {
  id: `section-${sectionId++}`, // ❌ This changes on every parse
  title: headingMatch[2].trim(),
  level: headingMatch[1].length,
  content: "",
};
```

**Problems:**

- Section IDs could shift when content was modified
- Re-parsing the same content could generate different IDs
- Section selection state would be lost when textarea was focused

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stable Section ID Generation

```typescript
// NEW: Stable ID generation based on heading text
const title = headingMatch[2].trim();
const stableId = generateStableSectionId(title, usedIds);

currentSection = {
  id: stableId, // ✅ Always the same for the same heading
  title: title,
  level: headingMatch[1].length,
  content: "",
};
```

### 2. ID Generation Algorithm

The `generateStableSectionId` function:

1. **Normalizes** heading text: lowercase, remove special chars
2. **Creates slug**: "Background Information" → "background-information"
3. **Handles duplicates**: "background-information-2" if needed
4. **Ensures uniqueness**: Tracks used IDs within the document

### 3. Examples of Generated IDs

| Heading Text           | Generated ID         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| "Introduction"         | "introduction"       |
| "Background & Context" | "background-context" |
| "Results (Phase 1)"    | "results-phase-1"    |
| "Methodology"          | "methodology"        |

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Section Matching**: Same heading always gets same ID
2. **Persistent Selection**: Active section survives content updates
3. **Reliable AI Updates**: Section-specific editing works correctly
4. **Better Debugging**: Clear, readable section IDs in logs

## Testing Verification

The fix includes enhanced logging to track:

- Section parsing results with stable IDs
- Section selection and matching
- Active section persistence during user interactions

## Next Steps

1. Test section-specific editing in Pro workspace
2. Verify active section persists during textarea interactions
3. Confirm AI responses update only selected sections
4. Monitor console logs for successful section matching

The stable section ID system ensures that the workspace editing feature works reliably and predictably.
