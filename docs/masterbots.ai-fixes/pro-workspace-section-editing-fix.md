# Pro Workspace Features - Infinite Loop Fixes & Section-Specific Editing

## Problem Summary

The document feature for the Pro workspace was experiencing two main issues:

1. **Infinite loop error**: "Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops."
2. **Document replacement issue**: AI was replacing the entire document instead of just updating the selected section.

## Root Causes Identified & Solutions Implemented

### 1. Infinite Loop in ChatPanelPro useEffect ✅ FIXED

**Location**: `/components/routes/pro/chat-panel-pro.tsx` (lines ~280-375)

**Issue**: A `useEffect` that was designed to update `filteredDocumentList` included a `setTimeout` that triggered another state update:

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (REMOVED):
useEffect(() => {
  // ... complex logic
  setFilteredDocumentList(newFilteredList || {});

  // THIS CAUSED THE INFINITE LOOP:
  const forceUpdate = setTimeout(() => {
    setFilteredDocumentList((prev) => {
      return { ...prev }; // Creates new reference, triggers re-render
    });
  }, 0);

  return () => clearTimeout(forceUpdate);
}, [documentType, textDocuments, imageDocuments, spreadsheetDocuments]);
```

**Root Cause**: The `setTimeout` callback created a new object reference every time, triggering the useEffect again, creating an infinite loop.

**Solution**: Removed the problematic `setTimeout` and simplified the useEffect to only update when actually needed.

### 2. Overly Complex documentOptions useMemo ✅ FIXED

**Location**: `/components/routes/pro/chat-panel-pro.tsx` (lines ~498-720)

**Issue**: A 200+ line `useMemo` with extensive logging, debugging, and complex reference tracking that was trying to force re-renders.

**Problems**:

- Deep copying with `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`
- Manual reference tracking with multiple useRef hooks
- Force updates for specific document types
- Complex change detection logic

**Solution**: Simplified the `useMemo` from 200+ lines to 15 lines with direct data access.

### 3. Problematic Monkey-Patching in ProExtended ✅ FIXED

**Location**: `/components/routes/pro/pro-extended.tsx`

**Issue**: Attempted to monkey-patch webpack module cache to enhance MessageRenderer:

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (REMOVED):
window.__webpack_require__.c;
// Accessing internal webpack cache
module.exports.MessageRenderer = (props) => {
  /* replacement */
};
```

**Problems**:

- Fragile and unsafe module cache manipulation
- Not compatible with modern React
- Could cause unexpected side effects

**Solution**: Replaced with clean component composition using ProExtended wrapper.

### 4. Document Replacement Issue ✅ FIXED

**Location**: `/lib/hooks/use-workspace-chat.tsx` and `/components/routes/pro/chat-panel-pro.tsx`

**Issue**: AI was replacing entire documents instead of updating selected sections.

**Root Causes**:

- Inadequate context in AI prompts about section-specific editing
- Document update logic treated all responses as full document replacements
- Missing section-specific instructions for the AI

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced Meta Prompt Generation

- **Section-Specific Mode**: When a section is selected, provides clear instructions to AI about updating only that section
- **Full Document Context**: Provides complete document structure for context while focusing on the selected section
- **Clear Output Format Instructions**: Explicitly tells AI to return only the updated section content

```tsx
// NEW APPROACH:
if (focusedSection) {
  taskInstructions = `
EDITING MODE: SECTION UPDATE
You are editing a specific section of a larger document. The user has selected the section "${focusedSection.title}" for editing.

IMPORTANT: You should ONLY return the updated content for the "${focusedSection.title}" section. Do NOT include the entire document or other sections in your response.`;
}
```

#### B. Improved Document Update Logic

- **Section-Specific Updates**: When a section is active, replaces only that section's content
- **Content Cleaning**: Removes any section headings that AI might include
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains the original document structure and other sections

```tsx
// Enhanced section update logic:
const updatedSections = [...sections];
const currentSection = updatedSections[sectionIndex];

// Clean the AI response - remove any heading that matches the section title
let cleanedResponse = aiResponse.trim();
const sectionTitleRegex = new RegExp(
  `^#{1,6}\\s*${currentSection.title}\\s*\n?`,
  "i",
);
cleanedResponse = cleanedResponse.replace(sectionTitleRegex, "");

// Replace only the section content
updatedSections[sectionIndex] = {
  ...currentSection,
  content: cleanedResponse.trim(),
};
```

### 5. Unused filteredDocumentList State ✅ FIXED

The `filteredDocumentList` state was not actually being used effectively but was causing unnecessary re-renders.

**Solution**: Removed unused state and simplified document filtering logic.

## Current Implementation

### Section-Specific Editing Flow

1. **User selects a section** in WorkspaceContent component
2. **Section ID is communicated** to WorkspaceChatProvider via `onActiveSectionChange`
3. **When user makes edit request**, meta prompt includes:
   - Full document context for understanding
   - Specific focus on selected section
   - Clear instructions to return only section content
4. **AI processes request** with section-specific context
5. **Document update** replaces only the selected section content
6. **Other sections remain untouched**

### Key Components

#### 1. Enhanced Meta Prompt (`createDocumentMetaPrompt`)

- Provides full document structure for context
- Clearly identifies the section being edited
- Instructs AI to return only section-specific content
- Includes chatbot expertise for specialized responses

#### 2. Improved Document Update (`handleDocumentUpdate`)

- Detects section-specific vs. full document updates
- Cleans AI responses to remove duplicate headings
- Preserves document structure and unedited sections
- Handles cursor position for precise placement

#### 3. Active Section Management

- `WorkspaceContent` manages local section state
- Communicates active section to `WorkspaceChatProvider`
- Enables section-specific editing mode

## Testing the Feature

1. **Navigate to Pro workspace mode**
2. **Select a document section** by clicking on it
3. **Make an edit request** (e.g., "expand this section with more details")
4. **Verify** that only the selected section is updated
5. **Check** that other sections remain unchanged

## Benefits of the New Implementation

✅ **No more infinite loops** - Clean, simple state management  
✅ **Section-specific editing** - Only selected sections are updated  
✅ **Document structure preservation** - Other sections remain intact  
✅ **Better AI context** - Clear instructions about editing scope  
✅ **Cleaner code** - Removed complex, problematic patterns  
✅ **Improved performance** - Eliminated unnecessary re-renders

## Technical Notes

### State Management Flow

```
WorkspaceContent (section selection)
    → onActiveSectionChange
    → WorkspaceChatProvider (activeWorkspaceSection state)
    → ChatPanelPro (createDocumentMetaPrompt with section context)
    → AI Response
    → handleDocumentUpdate (section-specific logic)
    → setDocumentContent (only updates target section)
```

### Error Prevention

- **useEffect dependencies**: Carefully managed to prevent infinite loops
- **Reference stability**: Avoided creating new object references unnecessarily
- **Content validation**: Cleans AI responses to prevent malformed updates
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when sections aren't found

This implementation ensures that the workspace document editing feature works as intended: expanding content in selected sections while preserving the rest of the document structure.
