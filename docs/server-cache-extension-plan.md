# Server Cache Extension Plan for Web Chat/Thread Reloads

## Overview

Implement server-side caching strategy to improve performance for chat/thread reloads in the web application.

## Current State Analysis

- Chat/thread data is fetched fresh on each reload
- No server-side caching mechanism in place
- API routes in `/apps/web/app/api/` handle chat operations
- GraphQL queries through Hasura for thread/message data

## Proposed Caching Strategy

### 1. Redis Cache Layer

- Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed thread/message data
- Cache key structure: `thread:{threadId}`, `messages:{threadId}`, `user_threads:{userId}`
- TTL: 15 minutes for active threads, 1 hour for inactive threads

### 2. API Route Modifications

- Update `/apps/web/app/api/chat/` endpoints to check cache first
- Implement cache invalidation on new messages
- Add cache warming for popular threads

### 3. GraphQL Query Optimization

- Cache GraphQL query results at the resolver level
- Implement DataLoader pattern for batched queries
- Use Hasura's query caching features

### 4. Client-Side Integration

- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
- Cache thread metadata in browser storage
- Optimistic updates with cache synchronization

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

- Set up Redis instance
- Create cache utility functions
- Add environment configuration

### Phase 2: API Integration

- Modify chat API routes to use cache
- Implement cache invalidation logic
- Add cache metrics and monitoring

### Phase 3: Client Optimization

- Update React hooks to use cached data
- Implement background refresh patterns
- Add offline support with cached data

## Performance Targets

- Reduce thread load time by 60%
- Improve perceived performance with instant cache hits
- Maintain data consistency with proper invalidation

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Thread load performance
- Memory usage tracking
- User experience metrics
